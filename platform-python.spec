# Unfortunately, rpmbuild's infrastructure requires us to jump through some

# defines __os_install_post.  In particular, "brp-python-bytecompile" is
# invoked without an argument thus using the wrong version of python
# (/usr/bin/python, rather than the freshly built python), thus leading to
# numerous syntax errors, and incorrect magic numbers in the .pyc files.  We
# thus override __os_install_post to avoid invoking this script:
%global __os_install_post /usr/lib/rpm/brp-compress \
  %{!?__debug_package:/usr/lib/rpm/brp-strip %{__strip}} \

  /usr/lib/rpm/brp-strip-comment-note %{__strip} %{__objdump} \

# to remove the invocation of brp-python-bytecompile, whilst keeping the

# 00111 #
# Patch the Makefile.pre.in so that the generated Makefile doesn't try to build
# a libpythonMAJOR.MINOR.a (bug 550692):
# Downstream only: not appropriate for upstream
Patch111: 00111-no-static-lib.patch

# 00132 #
# Add non-standard hooks to unittest for use in the "check" phase below, when
# running selftests within the build:
#   @unittest._skipInRpmBuild(reason)
# for tests that hang or fail intermittently within the build environment, and:
#   @unittest._expectedFailureInRpmBuild
# for tests that always fail within the build environment
#
# The hooks only take effect if WITHIN_PYTHON_RPM_BUILD is set in the
# environment, which we set manually in the appropriate portion of the "check"
# phase below (and which potentially other python-* rpms could set, to reuse
# these unittest hooks in their own "check" phases)
Patch132: 00132-add-rpmbuild-hooks-to-unittest.patch

# 00133 #
# 00133-skip-test_dl.patch is not relevant for python3: the "dl" module no
# longer exists

# 00137 #
# Some tests within distutils fail when run in an rpmbuild:
Patch137: 00137-skip-distutils-tests-that-fail-in-rpmbuild.patch

# 00146 #
# Support OpenSSL FIPS mode (e.g. when OPENSSL_FORCE_FIPS_MODE=1 is set)
# - handle failures from OpenSSL (e.g. on attempts to use MD5 in a
#   FIPS-enforcing environment)
# - add a new "usedforsecurity" keyword argument to the various digest
#   algorithms in hashlib so that you can whitelist a callsite with
#   "usedforsecurity=False"
# (sent upstream for python 3 as http://bugs.python.org/issue9216 ; see RHEL6
# python patch 119)
# - enforce usage of the _hashlib implementation: don't fall back to the _md5
#   and _sha* modules (leading to clearer error messages if fips selftests
#   fail)
# - don't build the _md5 and _sha* modules; rely on the _hashlib implementation
#   of hashlib
# (rhbz#563986)
# Note: Up to Python 3.4.0.b1, upstream had their own implementation of what
# they assumed would become sha3. This patch was adapted to give it the
# usedforsecurity argument, even though it did nothing (OpenSSL didn't have
# sha3 implementation at that time).In 3.4.0.b2, sha3 implementation was reverted
# (see http://bugs.python.org/issue16113), but the alterations were left in the
# patch, since they may be useful again if upstream decides to rerevert sha3
# implementation and OpenSSL still doesn't support it. For now, they're harmless.

# Avoid allocating thunks in ctypes unless absolutely necessary, to avoid

# embedding Python within httpd (rhbz#814391)
Patch155: 00155-avoid-ctypes-thunks.patch

# 00157 #
# Update uid/gid handling throughout the standard library: uid_t and gid_t are
# unsigned 32-bit values, but existing code often passed them through C long
# values, which are signed 32-bit values on 32-bit architectures, leading to
# negative int objects for uid/gid values >= 2^31 on 32-bit architectures.
#
# Introduce _PyObject_FromUid/Gid to convert uid_t/gid_t values to python
# objects, using int objects where the value will fit (long objects otherwise),
# and _PyArg_ParseUid/Gid to convert int/long to uid_t/gid_t, with -1 allowed
# as a special case (since this is given special meaning by the chown syscall)
#
# Update standard library to use this throughout for uid/gid values, so that
# very large uid/gid values are round-trippable, and -1 remains usable.

# Fix for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1023607
# Previously, this fixed a problem where some *.py files were not being
# bytecompiled properly during build. This was result of py_compile.compile
# raising exception when trying to convert test file with bad encoding, and
# thus not continuing bytecompilation for other files.
# This was fixed upstream, but the test hasn't been merged yet, so we keep it
Patch186: 00186-dont-raise-from-py_compile.patch

# 00188 #
# Downstream only patch that should be removed when we compile all guaranteed
# hashlib algorithms properly. The problem is this:
# - during tests, test_hashlib is imported and executed before test_lib2to3
# - if at least one hash function has failed, trying to import it triggers an
#   exception that is being caught and exception is logged:
#   http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2de806c8b070/Lib/hashlib.py#l217
# - logging the exception makes logging module run basicConfig
# - when lib2to3 tests are run again, lib2to3 runs basicConfig again, which
#   doesn't do anything, because it was run previously
#   (logging.root.handlers != []), which means that the default setup
#   (most importantly logging level) is not overriden. That means that a test
#   relying on this will fail (test_filename_changing_on_output_single_dir)

# We put the debug-gdb.py file inside /usr/lib/debug to avoid noise from
# ldconfig (rhbz:562980).
#
# The /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros defines %__debug_package to use
# debugfiles.list, and it appears that everything below /usr/lib/debug and
# (/usr/src/debug) gets added to this file (via LISTFILES) in
# /usr/lib/rpm/find-debuginfo.sh
#
# Hence by installing it below /usr/lib/debug we ensure it is added to the
# -debuginfo subpackage
# (if it doesn't, then the rpmbuild ought to fail since the debug-gdb.py
# payload file would be unpackaged)

# Workaround for rhbz#1476593
%undefine _debuginfo_subpackages
